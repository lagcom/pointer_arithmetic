# pointer_arithmetic
A basic pointer arithmetic program I wrote after attending some lecture about it.

# How to use
This program is written to compile in any standard version of C and C++, and you can use the included Makefile to compile it into most versions.<br>
The make command should be formatted like this: ```make pointer_arithmetic_[C##/CPP##].exe```<br>
Once it is compiled, you can simply run the program to see how to use it.
